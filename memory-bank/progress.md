## üöß Blockers & Risks

### **Current Blockers**: None ‚úÖ

### **Potential Risks**
- **Ollama Performance**: Need to test on 32GB RAM setup
- **Transcript Variability**: Edge cases in Zoom format handling
- **AI Quality**: Summary quality depends on prompt engineering
- **File Timing**: Zoom may write files incrementally

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Test Ollama thoroughly with various transcript sizes
- Build robust parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Iterate on AI prompts using real meeting data
- Implement file completion detection

---

## üìù Development Notes

### **Key Learnings**
- Zoom creates predictable folder structure: `YYYY-MM-DD HH.MM.SS [Title]/`
- Each meeting has exactly one file: `meeting_saved_closed_caption.txt`
- Transcript format is consistent: `[Speaker Name] HH:MM:SS` + content
- Mixed language content (Hindi/English) is common
- Meeting frequency is high (20+/week) - performance matters

### **Technical Decisions Made**
- **Local Processing**: Privacy-first approach with Ollama
- **Python**: Rich ecosystem for file monitoring and AI integration
- **Markdown Output**: Human-readable, version-controllable summaries
- **Incremental Architecture**: Start simple, add complexity gradually

### **Architecture Insights**
- Modular design allows independent component development
- Event-driven processing scales well for high meeting frequency
- File-based storage is simple and reliable for MVP
- Configuration-driven approach enables easy customization

- [ ] Configuration format: YAML vs. JSON vs. Python config
- [ ] Testing framework: pytest vs. unittest
- [ ] Error reporting: Console vs. file vs. both

### **Feature Priorities (Week 2)**
- [ ] Summary template: Fixed format vs. configurable
- [ ] Action item extraction: Regex patterns vs. AI-only
- [ ] File organization: Date-based vs. project-based
- [ ] Notification system: Terminal output vs. system notifications
