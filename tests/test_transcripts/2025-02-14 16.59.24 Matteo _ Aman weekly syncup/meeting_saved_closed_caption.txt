[Aman Ankur] 16:32:49
Hey, hi, Adios. Sorry, Ali. Kind of missed the time.

[Aman Ankur] 16:32:55
While it was… rig in between.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:32:55
Yeah. Yeah all this.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:33:01
Back-to-back meetings.

[Aman Ankur] 16:33:06
A little on the heavier side. For me, I usually keep all my one-on-ones to Fridays and Thursdays because I get some time to think about them on Wednesdays.

[Aman Ankur] 16:33:16
Because it's a gravity. Usually, my friend is all slightly heavier in terms of meetings.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:33:25
Mm-hmm.

[Aman Ankur] 16:33:26
Objectives? Are you done setting them up and putting them up?

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:33:31
But he didn't have time because like this week has been a bit weird that there was the training that workshop and then i didn't feel 100%.

[Aman Ankur] 16:33:42
Right.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:33:43
But also, I'm not sure I'm going to take most of like the um I'm thinking i'm going to… take most of the objective that we have coming raining down from from Niranjanan.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:34:01
Remove anything that is not specific to the team more or less that will be the case i need to understand if I need to phrase it in a smart way because some of those are really not smartable I don't know how much effort I want to put there.

[Aman Ankur] 16:34:19
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:34:23
Send a message to Niranjan because also we can change this. I can just put there the um objective as they are and then if if they are not smart enough we can maybe change it during the day.

[Aman Ankur] 16:34:39
Yeah, I kind of did something similar where i sort of gave the, I mean, I used Glean for that i thought of put those lungenians objectives over there and obviously gave the context of what is relevant to my team

[Aman Ankur] 16:34:55
And asked to… give some smart aspects of it in terms of measurable and time bound things was able to get some some you know some easier a way out of it and then essentially started working from there rather than

[Aman Ankur] 16:35:11
Doing it right from the beginning. I mean, that was a good baseline approach.

[Aman Ankur] 16:35:16
Where I started off. The weird part is we have a objective that comes from Ankit too who's the sem In Bangalore COE. So he's the line manager, manager is matrix manager And apparently I will have to imbibe the objects from both so it's

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:35:18
That's right.

[Aman Ankur] 16:35:38
Slightly more complicated however i mean uh keeping very ancillary specific objectives i was obviously stuck to what the engine has mostly written and we have some Bangalore related specific objectives which is mostly around team building and around attrition rate and around how do we understand the ways of working that's what I am

[Aman Ankur] 16:36:00
Essentially vibing from its objective so yeah i have a first initial draft ready. I'm basically adding the smart goals in comments because I don't want to commit it over there with timelines as of now.

[Aman Ankur] 16:36:14
I want to get it reviewed first and then I'll see how it goes.

[Aman Ankur] 16:36:19
So yeah uh i somehow thought that today was the last day at least but the engine was mentioning that today is the last day to submit for EMs. If you check the CCG EMs

[Aman Ankur] 16:36:35
Channel. Yesterday's last message binder Engine. It says that submit our objectives but tomorrow it's not true for Bangalore by the way i confirmed but you might want to check that for booking For managers, if they need to submit their objectives by today.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:36:55
Yeah, I think it is.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:37:01
The… the confusion could be that for at least for… Netherland and London.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:37:10
I see. The IC will start the objective next. A week But we need to basically is a chain. So the objective of the EM there to be finished today because from next week, we need to start the objective of the team members the people on the team.

[Aman Ankur] 16:37:17
Okay.

[Aman Ankur] 16:37:21
Yeah. Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:37:32
Okay, okay, got it.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:37:34
But at the same time, we already started some discussion. We already started to share the objective of Niranjan.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:37:43
And one challenge, well, not challenge, but one aspect that of course is not easy to solve is when teams are you know not splitting in a rigid way the topic amongst the people Then, of course, everyone has the same objective for everything, which is okay but you know it's

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:06
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:38:06
It's slightly more difficult to discuss with individuals. What are their objectives? Because I will put things like you know experiment quality for everyone but you know is… it's difficult to have a… specific contribution of one person towards the objective.

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:11
Yeah, yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:17
Yeah, yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:27
True. And to also make it measurable is also difficult It's a complete effort.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:38:32
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:36
I actually found the sessions quite insightful, at least me being new in the EM role in booking the PDP sessions for the SSE one and the exercises that we did it was quite helpful for me. I wanted to start building PDPs for my team, for myself

[Aman Ankur] 16:38:54
But had no idea where to begin from where But yeah, this was a pretty good session That's my request for the slides once again so I can have a look once again and just start off with some information uh i have i have two

[Aman Ankur] 16:39:13
Two core members in my team, no SEC ones, SECs yet but i have to SE2s.

[Aman Ankur] 16:39:21
One of them is quite good deep apakies. Also ambitious towards senior so i want to start crafting his his plans and his career framework so yeah it is something I'm still trying to understand and Look, in case you have any documents which helped you craft it for your team members in terms of

[Aman Ankur] 16:39:46
What the career objectives or what the career framework, the strength where they need to improve that sort of thing lies.

[Aman Ankur] 16:39:53
Let me know. I'll have a look and try to draft something similar for them so that I can keep on communicating with them and following it up with them in terms of where their progress lies But yet…

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:40:08
To be fair, I don't have it anything fancy because what I was doing in the past i was using the the workday objectives.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:40:17
To track what was the basically the the progression that we wanted to have There is a bit of a change of how we are handling objective this year for me because I was not including or i was adding like one objective something like

[Aman Ankur] 16:40:31
Okay.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:40:37
Okay out of the team a very generic thing. To just capture the the baseline of the work. But then everything else was mostly a development goal.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:40:50
And basically I need to start to do it in the format of a PDP now.

[Aman Ankur] 16:40:50
Got it.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:40:56
Which there are some examples I've seen around But yeah, we don't have like a common best practice yet.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:41:07
I mean, coming as we can see that from the workshop.

[Aman Ankur] 16:41:07
Understood.

[Aman Ankur] 16:41:11
Yeah, that's why I found it interesting that people had different ideas around it But good to gather them and uh I think the career framework is, I mean, it can be quite abstract at times to to drill it down to personal level is definitely

[Aman Ankur] 16:41:29
A task so i'm going to do that. Might reach out to you in case I need some help with understanding things.

[Aman Ankur] 16:41:37
That's going fine. Other than that, I think good to see. I mean, we've made quite a bit of progress right from the i mean from the last two, three weeks in terms of the multiplier approach we are now talking about

[Aman Ankur] 16:41:52
Important stuff at least getting into the mix of a lot of practical aspects. So good to see that happening i think

[Aman Ankur] 16:42:05
A lot of time a lot of time is obviously spent in bringing people to the same page but i guess now a lot of mostly they are on the same page in terms of what we are, what we're trying to do.

[Aman Ankur] 16:42:18
So we have hopefully the pace might pick from here and uh yeah i'll connect with you separately to further enhance that the documentation, the board that you're working on And then probably have other people involved and get their inputs to on the boundary and intervases yeah

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:42:41
Yeah. I think having from the meeting that we had there are to comment like pro and cons of having a larger group The pra, of course, is that we have expertise and we are discovering points that are gray Like not gray areas, mostly blind spot

[Aman Ankur] 16:42:53
Mm-hmm.

[Aman Ankur] 16:43:08
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:43:10
The cons, of course, is that we need to give a lot of context to people and kind of slow down sometimes not derail the discussion, but it brings it to topics that are not secondary but secondary you know important but maybe not important

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:43:31
The first step that we need to agree for having like a workable actionable.

[Aman Ankur] 16:43:35
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:43:37
Split uh but yeah But overall.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:43:42
It's good to have those feedback um so maybe as you are saying, I think, let me rephrase So I think we should keep having this meeting with those people but maybe we should also have some meetings with less people involved maybe me and you

[Aman Ankur] 16:43:59
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:44:04
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:44:04
Just to elaborate a bit more, the concept in the direction we want to we want to go.

[Aman Ankur] 16:44:09
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:44:10
So we don't risk to have risk large part of the meeting taken for give you context now every meeting there will be less context to give of course so this is good But yeah, it's just to keep it aligned to this let's say

[Aman Ankur] 16:44:20
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:44:24
Yeah, yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:44:36
February, end of February, we would like to have some draft of the plan, okay?

[Aman Ankur] 16:44:40
Yeah, same. I think. Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:44:42
Is not really going to happen end of February, start of March, let's say we should try to aim ourselves to do it before February, but maybe we should say okay realistically, it will arrive before mid-March, but that should be what we want to

[Aman Ankur] 16:45:01
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:45:04
Achieve. And end of February, we should already have an idea of what we want to have like we should not be in the discovery phase anymore we should have like

[Aman Ankur] 16:45:13
Yeah, absolutely. I think I also am drilling down more into the Cullinson API, trying to understand more real flows. I think that the dashboard, the meter to meter board is quite helpful in terms of really talking about the real things, not from the superficial level. So let's drill down further. I think when it comes to comes to content, we have still a lot of idea, but probably the further product details and

[Aman Ankur] 16:45:39
Order. Order aspect, probably in the next meeting between you and i we can drill down over that aspect how does the order fulfillment and how does the maybe the product selection part looks like And how do we CD abstraction happening over there, something like that

[Aman Ankur] 16:46:01
So that would give us much more, like maybe one or two more sessions between us will help us accelerate this where then we can again go back and give the context of where we are and then take more opinions

[Aman Ankur] 16:46:14
And more ideas around it.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:46:18
Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, I think we are aligned on this some of the concepts that we have like One important point that popped up yesterday, for example, was that And it's true.

[Aman Ankur] 16:46:19
Right. So I mean…

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:46:36
The part connected to the fulfillment and the order in that diagram is a bit chaotic and not Not yet.

[Aman Ankur] 16:46:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:46:44
And of course, there are some bits and pieces that a very big assumption. Do we want to aggregate potato thing is okay. In the purpose of speculating on what is the the capabilities that we will maybe need to have and what are the

[Aman Ankur] 16:46:54
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:47:02
Limits of any decision that we are making. The fact that there may be not an aggregation immediately at the start is true. The fact that we need to have some logic filtering logic on the side of of supplier is also something that we need to

[Aman Ankur] 16:47:04
Yeah, yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:47:14
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:47:28
Keep in mind, I think I heard something about veto discussing this topic and i didn't discussing attend the meeting or I missed the bit in which Vito was discussing some part of this discussion that there should be some service

[Aman Ankur] 16:47:48
No, no, I think… No, I don't think there was any other discussion. At least even I was not a part of it but i think in the approach, probably the one that we were having earlier with veto probably, sorry, in his ADR,

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:47:49
On the higher side you know to to discriminate

[Aman Ankur] 16:48:07
In this diagram probably there is a router and a aggregation, not an aggregation orchestration and a router layer which probably is being interpreted as a service rather than a rather than something else.

[Aman Ankur] 16:48:23
But I don't think we've had any other I don't think Vito has had any other discussions post the ones that we had with him or the ADA inclusion. But you can always ask him if what our assumption is is correct or not.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:48:34
Yeah, yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:48:41
The other thing that the discussion like maybe we should have like a another meeting with Vito.

[Aman Ankur] 16:48:49
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:48:49
Not immediately but we should start to think about having a meeting with Vito maybe we should set up a meeting set up a meeting trying to arrive prepared to the meeting with some discussion point of course we had the

[Aman Ankur] 16:48:56
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:49:04
The genetic architectural forum that is wednesday but that is the meeting with a lot of people.

[Aman Ankur] 16:49:11
Yeah, it's the most chaotic one so no absolutely want to split here from that one and have a very, very specific meeting with Vito where we we know what we are, what the agenda is.

[Aman Ankur] 16:49:26
And having had a prior discussion with me to have will give us pace to where he now knows what we are essentially talking and working about and then he can give a bit more context but yeah we can we can even propose for him that you know this is what we're trying to do this is what we

[Aman Ankur] 16:49:45
Plan to do and this is how we probably plan to migrate to your vision in the coming future years, days, months, whatever.

[Aman Ankur] 16:49:58
So yeah, I think having a separate meeting with him would be much more useful.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:50:02
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:50:06
Do we want to plan it already or just we give ourselves a little bit of time and then we plan it?

[Aman Ankur] 16:50:10
I think we should give us this next week for ourselves.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:50:14
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:50:14
I think you and I can have one or two more meetings in the drilling down of the boundaries. We are quite clear about the content. I want to make sure we are also very much clear about the product selection and the order aspects because i think you are anyways quite deep into that so it would be

[Aman Ankur] 16:50:32
Not a surprise for us more or less. And then we can essentially have a broader look at the entire thing and then have a discussion with Vito.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:50:45
The other question that I think we need to try To… agree on not you know agree on but How are we going to make a decision because of course we have options and And I don't know how your team feel in terms of

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:51:05
This option like this option Of course, we can still address it with veto and everything

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:51:16
How do you feel this decision making will happen? Because now that we are discussing in general about picking up options and describing scenario is fine but then we will have to make a decision Do you see any issue here?

[Aman Ankur] 16:51:28
Yeah, yeah. From what I can understand from now, at least discussions with my team.

[Aman Ankur] 16:51:37
I think definitely they have a preference, a strong preference for one way of doing it completely get that point.

[Aman Ankur] 16:51:48
To what I think what would be beneficial is beneficial is if Once… there is a lot of concerns around some very specific aspects of probably things related to real time development testing ownership, that sort of a thing when it comes to the options available. I think once we address that on how

[Aman Ankur] 16:52:16
Maybe via ways of working or via clear definition of what belongs where that might help in decision making probably. I don't think, I mean, honestly.

[Aman Ankur] 16:52:30
We are probably focusing going to focus at least me as a em will be focusing more on how can we get things done Rather than going back and forth about the different options.

[Aman Ankur] 16:52:42
Most important things is to like, you know, begin something and deliver it So either of the options are like definitely fine.

[Aman Ankur] 16:52:50
But probably some concerns around the options of How would this work out or how would that work out? We can probably have a discussion on that. That might give some more clarity and help getting a decision. I see, I also see strong points on why

[Aman Ankur] 16:53:10
The team is quite… insistent on having something separate which gives them a lot of independence, a lot of pace, a lot of independence Probably also they want to have a little bit more create impact in a way which can be probably also be measured in some way. And I'm sure that's also something that is

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:53:31
Of course, like, you know, the the benefit of having a service

[Aman Ankur] 16:53:34
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:53:40
Is there not only for the architectural point of view if you think about career framework having like a service that you own makes easier to say okay i i'm looking after this end-to-end donorship these arc these aspects so you know there is an interest.

[Aman Ankur] 16:53:55
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:54:00
That goes beyond architecture on having services and also the fact that on the long term you reduce the number of moment in which you need to synchronize with some other themes As long as you provide the interface you are more autonomous. So these are all things that are appealing and they have a value

[Aman Ankur] 16:54:22
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:54:30
I'm just thinking that like that.

[Aman Ankur] 16:54:30
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:54:36
There is a roadmap to arrive to anything that we want to have.

[Aman Ankur] 16:54:41
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:54:41
And we need to discuss, you know both what what is the What is the goal final end goal, but what is the next step If the team is happy to have If we can agree, for example.

[Aman Ankur] 16:54:45
Absolutely. Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:54:57
A draft agreement we can change it but if we can agree that at the start we will have like a certain naive solution And then we will

[Aman Ankur] 16:55:06
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I think we should probably i think i think i i also see that as the best way out i think one thing that the team probably is not looking at Where I see the advantage obviously is that obviously

[Aman Ankur] 16:55:22
Owning a service is also a bit of risk, right? You run having the risk of owning things which can go down, which you have to be completely focused on uh but the advantage of not immediately starting off with a service would be to

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:55:27
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:55:40
Have shared risk, but still getting the impact right Which is something which is probably not visible to the team, but I can see that and I will probably, you know.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:55:44
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

[Aman Ankur] 16:55:53
Defer that information and that angle to them too. I think I completely agree that could be one of the ways where we have a plan that you know we definitely want to arrive here we can begin with here with certain timelines or maybe just some milestones that you know the moment we have

[Aman Ankur] 16:56:11
Second or third supplier that is the time when you will reinitiate the discussion of service versus module and probably you know uh re go to the whiteboard and rethink about it. But until then, as long as we have one

[Aman Ankur] 16:56:27
Let's begin. Let's see the challenges let's see, do we really have those issues with testing, with issues with ownership issues with deployment, or it's more in our head i think uh Yeah, I'm with you on this, Mathieu. Not a concern at all. I see the benefits.

[Aman Ankur] 16:56:43
But yeah, I also see what the team is kind of thinking. In the end, I think in the end, the decision should should be one which takes us forward eventually so I am completely with you on this and uh

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:56:49
Of course.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:56:57
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:57:02
I i thing that could be the right approach where we begin with something but we have a clear uh you know clear thinking of how do we transition that would give them some idea on what are the things that they need to also probably focus on

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:57:15
Yep.

[Aman Ankur] 16:57:23
Find out the pros and cons practically rather than theoretically and then talk more on those terms.

[Aman Ankur] 16:57:29
That should be better.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:57:31
Yeah, I think… terminology and clarity is important like if the team is afraid that, you know, whatever we do at the start will stick forever. Of course, they will not like it. But if we start to think about it

[Aman Ankur] 16:57:45
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:57:51
Roadmap, we give a name to the phases whatever we like we we clarify that there are processes that are in parallel but with different goals. There is the goal of launching the first business cases like in a naive way.

[Aman Ankur] 16:58:00
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:58:12
Even with some difficulties in testing Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:58:15
Yeah, absolutely.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:58:18
We can put them at ease that meanwhile we are trying just to wait how different discussion are also ongoing. One is the learning from doing the job like we will learn more.

[Aman Ankur] 16:58:24
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 16:58:30
You know yeah

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:58:31
We will learn that certain things are needed some some things are maybe not needed some some aspects of the integration with universal workflow. There's a lot of things that will happen and we will learn so maybe our understanding will change in these months. But then there is a veto discussing with alexander. Maybe when we create service we need to do it in a specific way. We don't know yet.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:58:59
How they had to be created.

[Aman Ankur] 16:59:02
Thank you.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 16:59:06
If we put them at ease that you know we we all agree that having a better architecture respecting also the difference in the organizational split the fact that there is a time zone and everything maybe we will proceed faster in the decision.

[Aman Ankur] 16:59:24
I agree. I think let's go with that. I think that's a good way to think about it.

[Aman Ankur] 16:59:32
Putting everybody at ease, giving them the promise that you know they're their opinions and their opinions and their aspirations are also being looked at and uh having the work begin i think that's a I am with you on this. Let's go with that approach.

[Aman Ankur] 16:59:53
Yeah, I guess we are already on on the way of having more detailed discussions on the boundaries. Let's keep doing that.

[Aman Ankur] 17:00:04
For the actual implementation, I think I'm on the same page as you You and I and maybe Rishi can draft out that sort of a plan and then present it to maybe both veto and the team and see if they are okay with how we are planning to approach begin with this

[Aman Ankur] 17:00:19
Pick it up and then eventually as we grow and as we expand and scale we slowly move to the other approaches, maybe service-based or whatever that should kind of help us bring everybody to the same through the same excitement and same uh you know commitments

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:00:37
Yeah, I agree. I agree. I understand you're… You… are your people you yourself are in a situation that is a bit uncomfortable as well like handling a lot of services, handling a lot of supplier is exciting but you know it's

[Aman Ankur] 17:00:55
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:01:03
Potentially something that can go wrong easily. So to ensure that we all are supporting this process in the best way possible. The architecture should be making our life easy now.

[Aman Ankur] 17:01:07
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:01:19
Making it difficult. And if people are afraid, not afraid to leave afraid aware of the complexity that going forward may arrive.

[Aman Ankur] 17:01:22
Yeah.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:01:31
Of course they may become defensive in certain aspects. I don't think they are because they are very open but you know So far, as I said, we are so far discussing a lot of scenarios so if you can have an influence on them like

[Aman Ankur] 17:01:50
Yep.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:01:50
When you talk with them, try to make sure that you know we they feel like they feel hurt also from my side. I know you you are doing it but you know there is a lot of support from my side. It's just that we need to make a decision now for the immediate.

[Aman Ankur] 17:01:59
So, you know.

[Aman Ankur] 17:02:06
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that's a good point. I need to do that so that they understand that everybody's their well-being and I mean, in general, the multiplier well-being isn't everybody's concern and people are trying to reach a common goal i mean

[Aman Ankur] 17:02:24
Unless we our goal you wouldn't be able to reach your goals. So it's all tied up together in some way.

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:02:30
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 17:02:31
It's not us against them or something like that. So yeah, I'll make sure we are on the same page. I think probably just having some concerns and how we're gonna challenge how we're going to resolve that is something that might just help them out

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:02:46
Absolutely.

[Aman Ankur] 17:02:47
Learning a bit more and uh yeah we will we will we will arrive to that conclusion i don't think that should be a problem i've had a feelers with my team i don't They have a preference, but they don't have, how do you call it? They're not rigid. They're not stubborn about it. They just have a preference and they're trying to see how we can

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:03:07
Yeah.

[Aman Ankur] 17:03:07
Early on have that sentiment put across.

[Aman Ankur] 17:03:13
But yeah, I think… the most foreign and the foremost is how we deliver a task and nothing else

[Matteo Pavesi (EM, Flights Ancillary Coverage and Expansion, UK LON)] 17:03:21
Perfect.
