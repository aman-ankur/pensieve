**Quality Standards:**
- Use EXACT technical terminology from the conversation
- Reference SPECIFIC people by name with their contributions
- Include CONCRETE numbers, timelines, or metrics mentioned
- Capture REAL concerns and constraints, not generic ones
- Document ACTUAL system names and technical specifications
- NO generic phrases like "the team discussed" - be specific about WHO said WHAT

**For Mixed Language Content (Hindi/English):**
- Prioritize English for the summary structure
- Include important Hindi terms with English context when they add meaning
- Maintain technical accuracy across language switches

**Confidence Indicators:**
- Use "‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear from transcript:" for ambiguous sections
- Add "üí° Inferred:" for reasonable assumptions based on context
- Include "üîç Requires follow-up:" for items needing clarification

**Output Quality Check:**
Before finalizing, ensure your summary:
‚úÖ Contains specific technical terms and system names from the transcript
‚úÖ Includes concrete action items with real people and deadlines
‚úÖ Captures the actual business context and strategic importance
‚úÖ Documents specific technical decisions and architectural choices
‚úÖ Avoids generic business language in favor of precise terminology

Generate a comprehensive, actionable summary that would be valuable for someone who missed the meeting to understand exactly what was discussed and decided.
