STRICT INSTRUCTION: Create a comprehensive but concise summary in EXACTLY this format. Maximum 1200 words.

You MUST extract ALL action items explicitly. Look for phrases like:
- "we need to", "I'll do", "let's schedule", "action item", "follow up", "next step"
- Any task assignments or commitments made during the meeting
- Any deadlines or timelines mentioned

# Meeting Summary: {meeting_type}

**Meeting Info:**
- Date: [Date if mentioned]
- Participants: [Names and roles if mentioned - extract from transcript]
- Type: {meeting_type}
- Duration: [If mentioned]

## üéØ Key Outcomes
[2-3 sentences describing the main decisions made, agreements reached, or conclusions drawn. Focus on concrete results and strategic direction changes.]

## üìã Main Discussion Points
[List the 3-5 most important topics discussed. Use numbered list format:]
1. **Topic Name** (be specific about what was discussed)
   - Key point 1 (include technical details, names, dates)
   - Key point 2 (include concerns raised)
   - Key point 3 (include decisions made)

2. **Topic Name**
   - Key point 1
   - Key point 2

## ‚úÖ Action Items
[CRITICAL: You MUST format this section EXACTLY like this with numbered items:]
1. [First specific task] (Owner: [Name], Deadline: [Date])  
2. [Second specific task] (Owner: [Name])
3. [Third specific task] (Owner: [Name], Timeline: [When])
4. [Fourth specific task] (Owner: [Name])
5. [Fifth specific task] (Owner: [Name])

[Extract EVERY action item, task, or commitment mentioned. Look for "we need to", "I'll", "let's", "action", "follow up", "next step", scheduled meetings, deliverables, etc.]

## üîÑ Follow-ups & Next Steps
[List planned meetings, future discussions, or sequential steps:]
- [Next meeting or discussion planned with specific people]
- [Follow-up actions without specific owners]
- [Timeline expectations with dates]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers & Concerns
[If any issues, risks, or concerns were raised:]
1. **Category:**
   - Specific concern (be technical if needed)
   - Impact or risk
   - Mitigation if discussed

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST extract ALL action items - even if ownership is unclear, still list the task
- MUST use NUMBERED format for action items: "1. Task description (Owner: Name)"
- MUST include participant names and roles when mentioned in transcript
- MUST capture specific deadlines, timelines, and dates mentioned
- MUST list all follow-up meetings or discussions planned
- MUST include technical details (PDP, objectives, architecture, etc.) when they affect decisions
- MUST be specific with names, numbers, and concrete details
- MUST capture who said what when it's important for context
- Maximum 1200 words but prioritize completeness over brevity
- Look for implicit action items (things that need to be done even if not explicitly stated as "action items")

FORMAT ENFORCEMENT: If you write action items without numbers, you have FAILED the task.
